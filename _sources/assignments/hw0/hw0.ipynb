In a similar way, you can't evalaute the python expression `\"number:\" + 7`, because the `+` operator has different actions for strings and for ints.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you encounter an unfamiliar object in the course of writing python code, instead of throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks, it can be helpful to get to know the object better, in particular by asking what its `type` and, if applicable, `shape` is, as well as what attributes it has. This approach is similar how you might get to know a new friend, by asking the name, where the person is from, what the person does---you would not start by randomly guessing different names for a new person!"
