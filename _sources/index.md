## Course Description
Models and algorithms for discrete data. We will cover models ranging from generalized linear models to sequential latent variable models, autoregressive models, and transformers. On the algorithm side, we will cover a few techniques for convex optimization, as well as approximate Bayesian inference algorithms like MCMC and variational inference.

## Prerequisites
Students should be comfortable with probability and statistics as well as multivariate calculus and linear algebra. This course will emphasize implementing models and algorithms, so coding proficiency is required. 

## Logistics
- Time: Monday and Wednesday, 1:30-2:50pm
- Level: advanced undergrad and up
- Grading basis: credit or letter grade
- Office hours: TBD
